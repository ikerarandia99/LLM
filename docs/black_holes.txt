=== Introduction ===
Black holes are regions of space-time where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. 
They are one of the most fascinating predictions of general relativity.

=== Formation ===
Black holes are usually formed when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and collapse under their own gravity.
The collapse compresses matter into a singularity, a point of infinite density, surrounded by an event horizon.

=== Properties ===
- Event Horizon: the boundary beyond which nothing can return.
- Singularity: the central point where density and curvature become infinite.
- Hawking Radiation: theoretical radiation predicted by Stephen Hawking, suggesting that black holes can slowly evaporate.

=== Types of Black Holes ===
- Stellar black holes: formed by collapsing stars, with masses a few times greater than the Sun.
- Supermassive black holes: located at the centers of galaxies, with millions or billions of solar masses.
- Intermediate black holes: between stellar and supermassive in size, less commonly observed.

=== Conclusion ===
Black holes remain an active field of research, connecting astrophysics, relativity, and quantum theory. They challenge our understanding of the fundamental nature of space and time.
