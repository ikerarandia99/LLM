=== Introduction ===
General relativity, published by Einstein in 1915, is a theory of gravitation that describes gravity not as a force but as the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy.

=== Key Principles ===
- Equivalence Principle: the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable.
- Curved Space-Time: mass and energy warp space-time, guiding the motion of objects.
- Geodesics: objects follow the straightest possible paths in curved space-time.

=== Predictions ===
- Gravitational Time Dilation: time flows more slowly near strong gravitational fields.
- Gravitational Lensing: massive bodies bend light, acting as cosmic lenses.
- Gravitational Waves: ripples in space-time caused by accelerating massive objects, confirmed by LIGO in 2015.

=== Applications ===
- GPS technology requires corrections based on general relativity.
- Astrophysics uses it to explain the dynamics of galaxies and black holes.
- Cosmology relies on it to describe the expansion of the universe.

=== Conclusion ===
General relativity has passed every experimental test so far, yet it is incomplete because it does not integrate quantum mechanics. It remains one of the cornerstones of modern physics.
