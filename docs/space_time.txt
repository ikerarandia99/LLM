=== Introduction ===
The theory of space-time arises from the need to unify the notions of space and time into a single mathematical entity. 
Albert Einstein, with his theory of relativity, showed that space and time are not absolute, but depend on the observer.

=== Classical Space and Time ===
In Newtonian physics, space was considered a rigid and unchanging stage, and time a universal quantity that flowed identically for all observers.

=== Special Relativity ===
In 1905, Einstein formulated special relativity. 
He proposed that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers and that the speed of light is constant, regardless of the observer's motion.
This implied that time can dilate and lengths can contract depending on velocity.

=== General Relativity ===
In 1915, Einstein presented general relativity, which extended the theory to include gravity. 
Here, gravity is not a classical force, but the curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy.

=== Consequences and Examples ===
- Light bends when passing near massive bodies, such as the Sun.
- Time runs more slowly in strong gravitational fields, an effect confirmed with atomic clocks.
- The existence of black holes, regions where the curvature of space-time is extreme.

=== Conclusion ===
The theory of space-time radically changed our view of the universe, showing that space and time form a dynamic fabric that can expand, curve, and deform depending on the matter and energy it contains.
